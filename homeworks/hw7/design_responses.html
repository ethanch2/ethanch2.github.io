							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that Gestalt originated from Germany developed by German psychologists in 1920s. It's a developed theory to designing visuals that are perceived as aesthetic and make sense hierarchically. Design includes how psychology plays in visual percetion, affecting the way people think and interact with interfaces.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked how they talked about design through metaphors and not really focusing too much on UI. I think often times we get too stuck on a specific form of design when there is so much out there to be explored especially in nature. Gestalt principles teaches us how to apply design to different principles as an adapative system.</p>
