							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that good typography is purposeful and is tied to the form and function of design. Because typography makes up so much of a particular design, its important that it not detract from the overall look and feeling intended alongst with other assets like images and ui elements. I think its interesting how certain typefaces work well together and understand the ratios that work well both in terms of typescales and pairings.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part was the examples of typorgaphy styleguides which help to standardize and make designs feel more uniform. This can go hand in hand with color styles to achieve a great look and field in a particular design style. Ialso enjoyed reading about typography scales and found it interesting how it can be based on the golden ratio.</p>
