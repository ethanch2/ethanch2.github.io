                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned about various interaction patterns. I found the transition works really interesting by Zhenya Rynzhuk as well as the shopping app animations as well. I'm inspired to be able to achieve animations like such through CSS! </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part were all the variations of animations. I liked how they showed a great variety of them in different use cases. I also really enjoyed going on Muzli to get more design inspiration.  </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>I liked the easygrow.io app interactions the most. I think it achieves it through carefully timed animations, common interace gestures like swipe to the left and the drawer that can be pulled up. I find the large images to be very delightful as well, showcasing the different vegetables that can be grown. Typography and spacing is also used effectively to convey information in a way that's easy for users to process.</p>
