							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>White space is not wasted space but it helps create visual hierarchy and a better understanding of what the interface is representing. When objects are further separated, it helps the user develop a sense of focus and guides their experience in a delightful manner. Often times, rules like the 8px grid are used to maintain consistency across the product such that users feel connected throughout their experience. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked how the article showed visual representations of principles/concepts they were referring to. This helped form connections between how the UI is portrayed and how we can go about explaining how it was intentionally designed. I also enjoyed the discussion around various misconceptions as they helped clear up why white space is actually super valuable for design.</p>
