        <li>Everything in this world is designed in some way or another, and the best way to learn design is not only to utilize tools/applications but also to be aware of how and why they work the way they do. Thinking critically about design details helps us train our eye for design by understanding why certain elements work well contextually.</li>
        <li>I liked the deconstruction examples of common applications we use. It helps shed light on how designers may have crafted the experience for people as well as makes me more aware of how much thought goes into designing these interfaces.</li>
        <li>Next time you're sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way.</li>
        <li>8/10. I wished they had more concrete tips on how to improve design eye, but the general advice does help.</li>
